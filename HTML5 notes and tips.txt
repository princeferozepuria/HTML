HTML NOTES,TIPS AND RULES:-
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages
HTML elements are represented by tags
HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on
Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page

All HTML elements can have attributes
The title attribute provides additional "tool-tip" information
The href attribute provides address information for links
The width and height attributes provide size information for images
The alt attribute provides text for screen readers
At W3Schools we always use lowercase attribute names
At W3Schools we always quote attribute values with double quotes

HTML tags normally come in pairs like <p> and </p>
The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag
The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a forward slash inserted before the tag name

Tip: The start tag is also called the opening tag, and the end tag the closing tag.
Note: Only the content inside the <body> section (the white area above) is displayed in a browser.
Tip:HTML elements with no content are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag, such as the <br> element (which indicates a line break).
Tip:we always use lowercase tags.
Tip:we always use lowercase attribute names
Note:The alt attribute is also useful if the image does not exist:
Note:Using quotes are the most common. Omitting quotes can produce errors. 
we always use quotes around attribute values.

Note: Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading.
Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.
Note: Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, links, scripts, and other meta information.
Note: Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
Note: Dropping the end tag can produce unexpected results or errors.

Use the style attribute for styling HTML elements
Use background-color for background color
Use color for text colors
Use font-family for text fonts
Use font-size for text sizes
Use text-align for text alignment

Note: Browsers display <strong> as <b>, and <em> as <i>. However, there is a difference in the meaning of these tags: <b> and <i> defines bold and italic text, but <strong> and <em> means that the text is "important".

Note: Comments are not displayed by the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.

Use the HTML style attribute for inline styling
Use the HTML <style> element to define internal CSS
Use the HTML <link> element to refer to an external CSS file
Use the HTML <head> element to store <style> and <link> elements
Use the CSS color property for text colors
Use the CSS font-family property for text fonts
Use the CSS font-size property for text sizes
Use the CSS border property for borders
Use the CSS padding property for space inside the border
Use the CSS margin property for space outside the border

Note: A link does not have to be text. It can be an image or any other HTML element.
Note: Without a forward slash at the end of subfolder addresses, you might generate two requests to the server. Many servers will automatically add a forward slash to the end of the address, and then create a new request.
Tip: If your webpage is locked in a frame, you can use target="_top" to break out of the frame:
Note: border:0; is added to prevent IE9 (and earlier) from displaying a border around the image (when the image is a link).
Use the <a> element to define a link
Use the href attribute to define the link address
Use the target attribute to define where to open the linked document
Use the <img> element (inside <a>) to use an image as a link
Use the id attribute (id="value") to define bookmarks in a page
Use the href attribute (href="#value") to link to the bookmark

Note: The <td> elements are the data containers of the table.
They can contain all sorts of HTML elements; text, images, lists, other tables, etc.
Remember to define borders for both the table and the table cells.
Note: If the table has collapsed borders, border-spacing has no effect.
Note: The <caption> tag must be inserted immediately after the <table> tag.

Use the HTML <table> element to define a table
Use the HTML <tr> element to define a table row
Use the HTML <td> element to define a table data
Use the HTML <th> element to define a table heading
Use the HTML <caption> element to define a table caption
Use the CSS border property to define a border
Use the CSS border-collapse property to collapse cell borders
Use the CSS padding property to add padding to cells
Use the CSS text-align property to align cell text
Use the CSS border-spacing property to set the spacing between cells
Use the colspan attribute to make a cell span many columns
Use the rowspan attribute to make a cell span many rows
Use the id attribute to uniquely define one table


Note: List items can contain new list, and other HTML elements, like images and links, etc.

Use the HTML <ul> element to define an unordered list
Use the CSS list-style-type property to define the list item marker
Use the HTML <ol> element to define an ordered list
Use the HTML type attribute to define the numbering type
Use the HTML <li> element to define a list item
Use the HTML <dl> element to define a description list
Use the HTML <dt> element to define the description term
Use the HTML <dd> element to describe the term in a description list
Lists can be nested inside lists
List items can contain other HTML elements
Use the CSS property float:left or display:inline to display a list horizontally

The <div> element is a block-level element.

Tip: The class attribute can be used on any HTML element.
Note: The class name is case sensitive!
Tip: The id attribute can be used on any HTML element.
Note: The id value is case-sensitive.
Note:Difference Between Class and ID
An HTML element can only have one unique id that belongs to that single element, while a class name can be used by multiple elements:

Tips and Notes
Tip: To deal with browsers that do not support <iframe>, add a text between the opening <iframe> tag and the closing </iframe> tag.
Tip: Use CSS to style the <iframe> (even to include scrollbars).

Tips and Notes
Note: If the "src" attribute is present, the <script> element must be empty.
Tip: Also look at the <noscript> element for users that have disabled scripts in their browser, or have a browser that doesn't support client-side scripting.
Note: There are several ways an external script can be executed:
If async="async": The script is executed asynchronously with the rest of the page (the script will be executed while the page continues the parsing)
If async is not present and defer="defer": The script is executed when the page has finished parsing
If neither async or defer is present: The script is fetched and executed immediately, before the browser continues parsing the page

Tips and Notes
Note: If the <base> tag is present, it must have either an href attribute or a target attribute, or both.
Note: The <link> element is an empty element, it contains attributes only.
Note: This element goes only in the head section, but it can appear any number of times.
Note:-In XHTML the <link> tag must be properly closed.


Advantage of using an entity name: An entity name is easy to remember.
Disadvantage of using an entity name: Browsers may not support all entity names, but the support for numbers is good.
Note: Entity names are case sensitive.

URL Encoding
URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII character-set. If a URL contains characters outside the ASCII set, the URL has to be converted.
URL encoding converts non-ASCII characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet.
URL encoding replaces non-ASCII characters with a "%" followed by hexadecimal digits.
URLs cannot contain spaces. URL encoding normally replaces a space with a plus (+) sign, or %20.

Notes on GET:
Appends form-data into the URL in name/value pairs
The length of a URL is limited (about 3000 characters)
Never use GET to send sensitive data! (will be visible in the URL)
Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
GET is better for non-secure data, like query strings in Google

Notes on POST:
POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked
Note:Each input field must have a name attribute to be submitted.
If the name attribute is omitted, the data of that input field will not be sent at all.

Note: The <option> tag can be used without any attributes, but you usually need the value attribute, which indicates what is sent to the server.
Tip: If you have a long list of options, you can group related options with the <optgroup> tag.
Use <input> to create buttons in an HTML form.

Tip: Contact information inside a <footer> element should go inside an <address> tag.
Note: A <header> tag cannot be placed within a <footer>, <address> or another <header> element.
Note: There must not be more than one <main> element in a document. The <main> element must NOT be a descendant of an <article>, <aside>, <footer>, <header>, or <nav> element.
Note: The <meter> tag should not be used to indicate progress (as in a progress bar). For progress bars, use the <progress> tag.
Tip: Use the <progress> tag in conjunction with JavaScript to display the progress of a task.
Note: The <progress> tag is not suitable for representing a gauge (e.g. disk space usage or relevance of a query result). To represent a gauge, use the <meter> tag instead.


Note:-only MP4, WebM, and Ogg video are supported by the HTML5 standard.
Note:Different extensions like: .swf, .wav, .mp3, .mp4, .mpg, .wmv, and .avi.
Note:Only MP3, WAV, and Ogg audio are supported by the HTML5 standard.
Note: YouTube <object> and <embed> were deprecated from January 2015. You should migrate your videos to use <iframe> instead.

The id attribute cannot be used with: <base>, <head>, <html>, <meta>, <param>, <script>, <style>, and <title>.
The class attribute cannot be used with: <base>, <head>, <html>, <meta>, <param>, <script>, <style>, and <title>.
The style attribute cannot be used with: <base>, <head>, <html>, <meta>, <param>, <script>, <style>, and <title>.
The tabindex attribute can be used with: <a>, <area>, <button>, <input>, <object>, <select>, and <textarea>.
The title attribute cannot be used with: <base>, <head>, <html>, <meta>, <param>, <script>, <style>, and <title>.
